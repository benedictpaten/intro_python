    "\n",
    "* Up to now we've mainly used input() to get input to the programs we've written.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In the real world, this is not the way we generally get data into a program. Rather we read and write data to and from files.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Files, like documents, or spread sheets or images, are just semantically organized arrays of bits. \n",
    "\n",
    "* They can exist on a disk, be pulled from the internet or be created transiently as we pipe inputs and outputs from our programs. \n",
    "\n",
    "* They can be small, and they can be very large. Typically the data associated with a scientific analysis will be large relative to the size of the program. For this reason we have to think about processing the data in stages using streaming. \n",
    "\n",
    "Anyway, let's dive in... (as an aside, the examples today will show larger code samples than we've seen previously - you're leveling up)"
